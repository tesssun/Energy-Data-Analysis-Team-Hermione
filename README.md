# Forcasting wind-generated power
This project is a part of the University College London's module Energy Data Analytics, contributed by Siying Sun, Zehao Wang and Charles Dowlat.
This is a research project focusing on predicting the wind power generation based on wind's speed, directions and air pressure.

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to use three variables, wind speed, direction and air pressure to predict future wind-generated power output. Another independent forcast is to use only time series to predict wind-gerated power output.

### Methods Used
* Inferential Statistics
* Machine Learning
* Data Visualization
* Predictive Modeling
* etc.

### Technologies
* R

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo (for help see this [tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)).
2. Raw Data is being kept [here](Repo folder containing raw data) within this repo.

    *If using offline data mention that and how they may obtain the data from the froup)*
    
3. Data processing/transformation scripts are being kept [here](Repo folder containing data processing scripts/notebooks)
